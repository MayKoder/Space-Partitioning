# Space Partitioning - Research Project

I am [Miquel Suau](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miquel-suau-gonz%C3%A0lez-346b5617a/), student of the [Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/). This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer [Marc Garrigó](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgarrigo/).

I made a more extensive website speaking about space partitioning and its uses, check it [HERE](https://maykoder.github.io/Space-Partitioning/).
